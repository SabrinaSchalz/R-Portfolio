This is a collection of R scripts, mainly using the tidyverse package. It includes samples from my own published papers and preprints, as well as side projects / puzzles / competitions:

ABM:
An Agent-Based Model to test the relationship between one focal behaviour (eavesdropping) with several environmental variables. The crow in the model gains points from foraging on a patch, but needs to avoid encounters with the human so as to not lose points. The file "eavesdropping monitoring hopping" has the baseline outcomes when all behaviours are enabled and environmental conditions are set to default. The other files are variations of each environmental condition.

Behaviours Towards Crows Survey: this folder contains two scripts: one is the code I used for a paper on how London residents behave towards crows. The other is a simulation of "experience points" adding up for each positive and negative encounter crows have with humans, based on the reported frequencies of human behaviours towards crows (not included in the paper). The original paper is here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356727449_Attitudes_and_Behaviours_Towards_Carrion_Crows_in_London and I also wrote a blog post about it (including extra data for Milton Keynes that wasn't part of the original paper, as well as the cumulative experience simulation): https://sabrinaschalz.wordpress.com/2022/12/09/attitudes-and-behaviours-towards-carrion-crows-in-london-and-milton-keynes/

Crow Speech Playback: this is the code I used to analyse and plot the data I collected from my speech playback experiments with wild crows. The paper is currently under review, I'll link to it and write a blog post about it once published.

Litter Foraging: this is the code I used to analyse our citizen science survey on birds foraging in litter. The preprint is uploaded here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.16.468840v1 and the blog post summarizing our data is here: https://sabrinaschalz.wordpress.com/2022/12/09/birds-foraging-in-litter/

TidyTuesday: A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

Psychology experiment cats: this is the code I used to analyse data from an experiment with human participants tasked to discriminate cats (and in a different version, crows) by their voices. The paper can be found here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/304034cn

K-means clustering birds by song: this is the script I used to analyse unpublished data collected by Warren-Horrod Wilson in joint project. The aim was to find clusters of acoustic parameters in crow calls.
